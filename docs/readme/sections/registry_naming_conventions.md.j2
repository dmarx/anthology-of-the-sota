## Naming Conventions

1. **Format**: hyphenated-lowercase
   ```
   good: training-optimization
   bad: TrainingOptimization, training_optimization
   ```

2. **Process Topics**: Use gerund (-ing) form
   ```
   good: training-optimization, model-scaling
   bad: train-optimization, scale-models
   ```

3. **Component Topics**: Use noun form
   ```
   good: model-architecture, attention-techniques
   bad: modeling-architecture, attending-techniques
   ```

4. **Standard Suffixes**:
   - `-optimization`: Performance-focused topics
   - `-techniques`: Methodology-focused topics
   - `-architecture`: Structural topics
   - `-pipeline`: Process flow topics

## Migration Guide

1. **Recommendation Tagging**:
   - Each recommendation should be tagged with exactly one primary topic
   - Can have additional secondary topic tags if needed
   - Use most specific applicable topic

2. **Topic Metadata**:
   - Each topic should have:
     - Clear scope definition
     - Parent topic (if applicable)
     - Related topics
     - Key references

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   1. Create new topic structure
   2. Map existing recommendations to new topics
   3. Update all recommendation tags
   4. Add metadata to topics
   5. Review for consistency

## Topic Maintenance Rules

1. **Adding New Topics**:
   - Must follow naming conventions
   - Must have clear, non-overlapping scope
   - Must include scope definition and metadata
   - Should fit within existing hierarchy

2. **Merging Topics**:
   - Required when scope overlap exceeds 50%
   - Must migrate all recommendations
   - Must update all references

3. **Splitting Topics**:
   - Required when topic becomes too broad
   - Must have clear dividing criteria
   - Should maintain naming consistency

4. **Deprecating Topics**:
   - Mark as deprecated with reason
   - Migrate or archive recommendations
   - Maintain historical record
