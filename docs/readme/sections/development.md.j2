## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization for LLM Interaction

When developing this project (or using it as a template), keep in mind these guidelines for effective collaboration with Large Language Models:

1. **File Length and Modularity**
   - Keep files short and focused on a single responsibility
   - If you find yourself using comments like "... rest remains the same" or "... etc", the file is too long
   - Files should be completely replaceable in a single LLM interaction
   - Long files should be split into logical components

2. **Dependencies**
   - All dependencies managed in `pyproject.toml`
   - Optional dependencies grouped by feature:
     ```toml
     [project.optional-dependencies]
     test = ["pytest", ...]
     site = ["markdown2", ...]
     all = ["pytest", "markdown2", ...]  # Everything
     ```
   - Use appropriate groups during development:
     ```bash
     pip install -e ".[test]"  # Just testing
     pip install -e ".[all]"   # Everything
     ```

3. **Testing Standards**
   - Every new feature needs tests
   - Write tests before starting on new features to formalize expected behavior (i.e. TDD)
   - Tests should be clear and focused
   - Use pytest fixtures for common setups
   - All workflows depend on tests passing
   - Test files should follow same modularity principles
   - Use `pytest` fixtures for common setups
   - Keep tests focused and well-documented

4. **Why This Matters**
   - LLMs work best with clear, focused contexts
   - Complete file contents are better than partial updates with ellipsis
   - Tests provide clear examples of intended behavior
   - Shorter files make it easier for LLMs to:
     - Understand the complete context
     - Suggest accurate modifications
     - Maintain consistency
     - Avoid potential errors from incomplete information

5. **Best Practices**
   - Aim for files under 200 lines
   - Each file should have a single, clear purpose
   - Use directory structure to organize related components
   - Prefer many small files over few large files
   - Consider splitting when files require partial updates

6. **Project Conventions**
   - Use `loguru` for all logging
   - Use `fire` for CLI interfaces
   - Type hints should use:
     - Built-in generics over typing module (PEP 585)
     - Union operator (`|`) over Optional (PEP 604)
   - Github Actions is the only available runtime for script execution
   - All workflows depend on tests passing
